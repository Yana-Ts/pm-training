# Questions:

> What are the most popular IDEs for development?
The choice of the IDE depends on the following factors:  the programming languages it can support, operational system you use, platforms that you plan to develop, ease of use, cost and many other. That is why it is very difficult to choose most popular IDE among all.
Currently ratings show the most popular IDEs for development such as: Visual Studio, Android Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, PayCharm, IntelliJ Idea and Xcode.


> What is .gitignore file for?
A .gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Ignored files are usually build artifacts and machine generated files that can be derived from your repository source or should otherwise not be committed. Some common examples are:
•	dependency caches, such as the contents of /node_modules or /packages
•	compiled code, such as .o, .pyc, and .class files
•	build output directories, such as /bin, /out, or /target
•	files generated at runtime, such as .log, .lock, or .tmp
•	hidden system files, such as .DS_Store or Thumbs.db
•	personal IDE config files, such as .idea/workspace.xml
Ignored files are tracked in a special file named .gitignore that is checked in at the root of your repository. There is no explicit git ignore command: instead the .gitignore file must be edited and committed by hand when you have new files that you wish to ignore. .gitignore files contain patterns that are matched against file names in your repository to determine whether or not they should be ignored.

> What's the difference between compiled and interpreted language?
In the case of compiled languages, the original source code is read over compile time, checked for syntax and type errors and converted to a platform specific binary executable. This executable is then executed again and again in its target platform.  There will be a different executable for every platform combinations like Windows 64 bit, Windows 32 bit, Linux, Mac etc.
In the case of interpreted languages, source program is translated into machine code and executed line by line, directly at target machine.  Here source program is directly executed on the target platform by an interpreter; so the same executable is shipped to every platform, and hence is portable. There will be only one version of the executable for every platform.
Pros for compiled languages:
1.	Speed – Since the source code is already converted into native platform specific code, the code can be executed directly without anymore translation.
2.	Type checking – Since compilation work in phases and has access to whole code and types declared, it can do syntax checks and type checking, and this avoiding any possible runtime errors due to type mismatch. If you have a variable of type int, and if you assign it any other type and then if you use an int operation, your code might throw a runtime exception. This is avoided by type checking of the compiler.
 
Pros for interpreted languages
Interpreted languages also have a very important property, which is:
1.	Portability – Since the source code itself or a platform independent executable is shipped to the target machine, the executable is platform independent and hence it is portable across platforms. However, note that there should be a platform specific interpreter installed in the target machine, that can convert this platform independent executable to that particular platform specific machine code and execute it.

> What are the different types of web hosting exist? 
There are four basic types of the web hosting based on the technology used for server: 
1. Shared hosting when a site is located on the same server as a bunch of other websites.
2. VPS hosting. VPS stands for Virtual Private Server. While all sites on VPS share one physical server, it houses multiple, separate virtual machines.
3. Dedicated hosting. Server is all for youself.
4. Cloud hosting. This type of hosting is similar to VPS, however, instead of one physical server, your site is part of a whole network of computers from which it can pull all the power it needs dynamically.
